# LoginSwingTask

Write an application consisting of one swing window.
The window should have two fields for entering text 
(name and email address), a button to confirm the entry,
and a table in which the entered data will be written.
The entered name and address must be checked according to the rules:
· The address consists of two parts, separated by "@"
· The address can consist of letters of the Latin alphabet, 
    numbers and symbols "-", "_", ".", 
    But it can start only with letters of the Latin alphabet
· The name must consist of letters of the Latin alphabet, 
it can consist of several words separated by spaces, but no more than 4 words

By clicking on the button, the data from the input fields must be written 
into the plate, and the input fields must be cleared.
At the end of the program, the data from the table must be saved to a file, 
and when the application is restarted, it must be read and displayed in the table.
When implementing it, it is desirable to make the most of java's capabilities, 
try to build the application in such a way that future expansion of the functionality, 
for example, adding 1 more input field, would cost as few edits as possible.
